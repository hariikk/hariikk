### Hi there, I'm Hari 👋



I'm a Master's student in **Autonomous Systems** at the **Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg (HBRS)**, where I'm focusing on the intersection of robotics, multi-sensor data, and machine learning.

My goal is to develop robust, intelligent systems, and I'm actively building my skills through hands-on research and development. My projects often involve simulation, control systems, and applying ML models to real-world robotics challenges.
