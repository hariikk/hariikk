### Hi there, I'm hariikk 👋



I'm a Master's student in **Autonomous Systems** at the **Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg (HBRS)**, where I'm focusing on the intersection of robotics, multi-sensor data, and machine learning.

My goal is to develop robust, intelligent systems, and I'm actively building my skills through hands-on research and development. My projects often involve simulation, control systems, and applying ML models to real-world robotics challenges.

### 🚀 My Key Projects

I'm passionate about building and simulating intelligent systems. Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

* **[Car-maneuver-trajectory-simulation](link-to-repo)**: An SDP project simulating complex car maneuvers based on real multi-sensor data and Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs).
* **[Multi-Robot-System](link-to-repo)**: Developing coordination and control strategies for a team of autonomous robots.
* **[Self-Organizing-Systems-Projects](link-to-repo)**: Exploring decentralized control and emergent behavior in systems using Jupyter Notebooks for simulation.
* **[Hack4Surgery](link-to-repo)**: A Python-based project developed for the Universitätsklinikum Bonn hackathon, applying data-driven solutions to surgical challenges.
* **[Robotics_Development_Projects](link-to-repo)**: A collection of my development work in robotics, focusing on Python-based solutions.
* **[AI_helper_robot](link-to-repo)**: An exploration into building an intelligent robotic assistant using machine learning.
